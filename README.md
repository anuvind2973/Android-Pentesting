## **Platform Overview**

Let's start with androd Arcitecturer overview 
Android is an open source, The foundation of the Android platform is the Linux kernel. Andrid is developed for ARM architeture and later expanded to support x86 and x86-64 architectuer.

## **Linux kernel**

The Linux kernel is the heart of the Android operating system.The Linux kernel was chosen for a variety of reasons. Most notably, Linux is a portable operating system that can be quickly built on a variety of hardware.The kernel serves as a layer of abstraction between the device's software and hardware.At the heart of the Android operating system lies a modified version of a Linux LTS kernel that interacts directly with the hardware.The Linux Kernel is the foundation layer of the Android architecture, responsible for managing hardware resources using drivers such as memory, CPU, and input/output. It also provides essential services such as security and process management.

## **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): The HAL layer provides an interface between the Android framework and the underlying hardware of the device. It is responsible for managing low-level hardware resources such as sensors, cameras, and audio hardware.

## **Android Runtime**

Android Runtime is the virtual machine that executes application code contained in Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. It manages code compilation, debugging, and garbage collection. Each application runs with its own instance of ART, i.e. in its own virtual machine, to ensure code isolation. ART replaced Dalvik as Android’s Java virtual machine in 2013 as its Ahead-of-Time compilation provided improved performance over the latter’s Just-in-Time compilation.


## **Android Native Development Kit (NDK) vs Android Software Development Kit (SDK)**


Android Native Development Kit (NDK) is a toolset that allows developers to reuse code written in C/C++ programming languages and incorporate it to their app through Java Native Interface (JNI). Since the app will run directly in the processor, instead of being interpreted by Dalvik Virtual Machine, it will gain some extra speed.

Besides, code written in C/C++ for Android can be easily ported and run in other platform such as iOS or Windows.  Useful if you develop a multi platform application.

NDK will also increase your app complexity, however, it will limit your app functionality. For this reason, you should know that it must be used only if it is essential to your app. First, look for Android framework APIs and check if they can provide you the functionality you need.

What is the difference?
Android Software Development Kit (SDK), on the other hand, uses Java programming language, and includes sample projects, development tools and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Android Studio. It also provides all the common APIs used for Android apps.

It is important to mention that some Android Apps use NDK to achieve a specific functionality. That makes NDK and SDK somehow complementary in some cases. However, Android still recommends to only used NDK if you really need to.

With the help of online communities and forums, we elaborate a infographic that explain some of the main reasons to use one kit over the other:

 

Reasons to use NDK
Great for CPU intensive operations: mobile videogames, signal processing or physics simulations. Run computationally intensive applications.
Porting existing C/C++ code to Android.
Developing a multiplatform application (iOS, Windows).
Reasons to use SDK
Ensured device portability despite processor architecture
Rich set of libraries
Automatic memory management
